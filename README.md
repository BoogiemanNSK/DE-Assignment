# Differential Equation Graph Plotting Application

This app shows how different numeric methods (Euler, Improved Euler, Runge-Kutta) can be used to solve a first-order DE y'=x^3y^3-x/y and also plots graph of its analytical solution to compare results and show effectiveness of each method.

Programs is written on Qt C++ and using QCustomPlot library to plot graphs.

* BIN folder contains binaries for Windows.
* DOC folder contains documentation (Analytical solution, Review of results, UML diagram).
* SRC folder is for code and projetc files.
